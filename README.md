# Galois Java Programming Repository #

## Java programming repository ##

This Java programming repository is the main repository that keeps track of the main Java open source development & practice work that is ongoing. This work is replicated across multiple languages & represents an ongoing pursuit of professional development & computing excellence. This work is also to be used as an internal guide that supports the training and development of all engineering & data science staff at Cardinal Path, as well as those participating in my various study groups & in my classes at Simon Fraser University, the BC Institute of Technology, and the Georgia Institute Of Technology!

## Who Was Galois ##

[Galois, who died before the age of twenty-one](http://fabpedigree.com/james/mathmen.htm#Galois "Galois"), not only never became a professor, but was barely allowed to study as an undergraduate. His output of papers, mostly published posthumously, is much smaller than most of the others on this list, yet it is considered among the most awesome works in mathematics. He applied group theory to the theory of equations, revolutionizing both fields. (Galois coined the mathematical term group.) While Abel was the first to prove that some polynomial equations had no algebraic solutions, Galois established the necessary and sufficient condition for algebraic solutions to exist. His principal treatise was a letter he wrote the night before his fatal duel, of which Hermann Weyl wrote: "This letter, if judged by the novelty and profundity of ideas it contains, is perhaps the most substantial piece of writing in the whole literature of mankind." Galois' last words (spoken to his brother) were "Ne pleure pas, Alfred! J'ai besoin de tout mon courage pour mourir Ã  vingt ans!" This tormented life, with its pointless early end, is one of the great tragedies of mathematical history. Although Galois' group theory is considered one of the greatest developments of 19th century mathematics, Galois' writings were largely ignored until the revolutionary work of Klein and Lie.
