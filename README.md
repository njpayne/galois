# Galois #

## Java programming repository ##

This Java programming repository is the main repository that keeps track of the main Java open source development & practice work that is ongoing. This work is replicated across multiple languages & represents an ongoing pursuit of professional development & computing excellence. This work is also to be used as an internal guide that supports the training and development of all engineering & data science staff at Cardinal Path, as well as those participating in my various study groups & in my classes at Simon Fraser University, the BC Institute of Technology, and the Georgia Institute Of Technology!

## Who Was Galois ##

[Galois, who died before the age of twenty-one](http://fabpedigree.com/james/mathmen.htm#Galois "Galois"), not only never became a professor, but was barely allowed to study as an undergraduate. His output of papers, mostly published posthumously, is much smaller than most of the others on this list, yet it is considered among the most awesome works in mathematics. He applied group theory to the theory of equations, revolutionizing both fields. (Galois coined the mathematical term group.) While Abel was the first to prove that some polynomial equations had no algebraic solutions, Galois established the necessary and sufficient condition for algebraic solutions to exist. His principal treatise was a letter he wrote the night before his fatal duel, of which Hermann Weyl wrote: "This letter, if judged by the novelty and profundity of ideas it contains, is perhaps the most substantial piece of writing in the whole literature of mankind." Galois' last words (spoken to his brother) were "Ne pleure pas, Alfred! J'ai besoin de tout mon courage pour mourir à vingt ans!" This tormented life, with its pointless early end, is one of the great tragedies of mathematical history. Although Galois' group theory is considered one of the greatest developments of 19th century mathematics, Galois' writings were largely ignored until the revolutionary work of Klein and Lie.

## Subjects Areas & Questions ##

### Elementary Programming (Project: elementary) ###

- (Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit) Write a program that reads a Celsius degree in - a double value from the console, then converts it to Fahrenheit and displays the - result. The formula for the conversion is as follows: fahrenheit = (9 / 5) * celsius + 32 **(Program completed August 7, 2015)**

- (Compute the volume of a cylinder) Write a program that reads in the radius and length of a cylinder and computes the area and volume using the following formulas: area = radius * radius **(Program completed August 7, 2015)**

- (Convert feet into meters) Write a program that reads a number in feet, converts it to meters, and displays the result. One foot is 0.305 meters. **(Program completed August 8, 2015)**

- (Financial application: calculate tips) Write a program that reads the subtotal and the gratuity rate, then computes the gratuity and total. For example, if the
user enters 10 for subtotal and 15% for gratuity rate, the program displays $1.5 as gratuity and $11.5 as total.

- (Convert pounds into kilograms) Write a program that converts pounds into kilograms. The program prompts the user to enter a number in pounds, converts it to kilograms, and displays the result. One pound is 0.454 kilograms. **(Program completed August 8, 2015)**

- (Sum the digits in an integer) Write a program that reads an integer between 0 and 1000 and adds all the digits in the integer. For example, if an integer is 932, the sum of all its digits is 14. Hint: Use the % operator to extract digits, and use the / operator to remove the
extracted digit. For instance, 932 % 10 = 2 and 932 / 10 = 93. **(Program completed September 1, 2015)**

- (Science: calculating energy) Write a program that calculates the energy needed to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature. Your program
should prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial and final temperatures of the water. The formula to compute the energy is Q = M * (finalTemperature – initialTemperature) * 4184
where M is the weight of water in kilograms, temperatures are in degrees Celsius, and energy Q is measured in joules. **(Program completed August 10, 2015)**

- (Geometry: distance of two points) Write a program that prompts the user to enter two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and displays their distance between them. The formula for computing the distance is sqrt((x2 x1)^2 + (y2 y1)^2). Note that you can use Math.pow(a, 0.5) to compute sqrt(a). **(Program completed August 10, 2015)**

- (Print a table) Write a program that displays the following table. Cast floatingpoint numbers into integers.
a b pow(a, b)
1 2 1
2 3 8
3 4 81
4 5 1024
5 6 15625
