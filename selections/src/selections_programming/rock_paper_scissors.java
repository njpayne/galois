// Write a program that plays the popular scissor-rockpaper
// game. (A scissor can cut a paper, a rock can knock a scissor, and a paper can
// wrap a rock.) The program randomly generates a number 0, 1, or 2 representing
// scissor, rock, and paper. The program prompts the user to enter a number 0, 1, or
// 2 and displays a message indicating whether the user or the computer wins, loses,
// or draws. Here are sample runs:
// scissor (0), rock (1), paper (2):
// The computer is scissor. You are rock. You won
